    I like to keep a record of the projects I work on even if I can't post the code online.
    This project is a placeholder for a ruby on rails system I developed at Impala-Technology
    for managing parking tickets. It is a SAAS version of the current Progress software developed
    for the desktop.
    
    If you are interested in seeing the system or need parking systems contact kloughnane@impala-technoloy.com
    or akeating@impala-technology.com
